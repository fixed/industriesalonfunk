==================

Putting together an interactive media-device which lets users switch through content of industriesalon.de by tuning into "channels" on an old radio from the 20s.

## Roadmap

  1. Setup a minimal Node application to serve static files (audio, video, configuration)

  2. Make a browser client which features a mousewheel area, an WebGL canvas, and an audio namespace

  3. Define a configuration schema which holds informations about the "channels" (frequency, distortion limit, media files, playback configuration) + a sample config

  4. Define a minimal main-component to which the audio/video components can listen for events (like frequency changes)

  5. Build the audio component

  6. Build the video component

  7. Get content!

  8. Get an old radio to disassemble

  9. Take apart a laptop and put the damn thing into the radio-housing!

  10. Win.
